I have put together the face recognition demo based on Google's
facenet project. The python based solution was written adopting
Object Oriented programming model so that it can be scaled for
other types of face recognition solutions etc. For example, various
classes are defined like Face, FaceModel etc which can contain
implementation of your choice. The ML framework used for this project
is Tensorflow. Although this project is little dated, it can be
easily upgraded for it to run on bleeding edge of Tensorflow or
even a PyTorch based solution can also be newly defined.

This project can be found here:\
