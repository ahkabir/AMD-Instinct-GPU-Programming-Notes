# ROCm useful information related to installations and others

To get a very good overview of AMD GPU architecture and ROCm
watching this webinar is a must:\

[`Webinar - Introduction to Portable GPU Programming`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBs7Xd3SH48&list=PLx15eYqzJifdTCHZC6Py2rev5nNr8pr7s)

After you understand the architecture we can dive into the following
detailed video presentation to learn about ROCm, HIP programming etc:\

## Testing ROCm installation
Following the ROCm website, it is quite straightforward to install it but
testing the installation is not easy as you need this GPU is not
accessible that widely through cloud vendor. AMD has `AMD Accelerator Cloud`
website that allows people to use AMD Instict GPU through cloud but you
need to signup in that website first. The signup process is not open to
any one individual.
