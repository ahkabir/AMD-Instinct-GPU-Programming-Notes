## Testing ROCm installation
Following the ROCm website, it is quite straightforward to install it but
testing the installation is not easy as you need this GPU is not
accessible that widely through cloud vendor. AMD has `AMD Accelerator Cloud`
website that allows people to use AMD Instict GPU through cloud but you
need to signup in that website first. The signup process is not open to
any one individual.
