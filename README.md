# AMD-Instinct-GPU-Programming-Notes
In this repository, I put links to important resources that will enable a
developer/reader/user to ramp on AMD Instinct GPU. It also contains
code snippets for GPU programming and briefly describes ROCm development
flows.
In addition, it also described some of the relevant datacenter specific
things in the context of executing Machine Learning Workload or HPC
Workloads.
